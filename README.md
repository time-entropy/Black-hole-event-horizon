# Black-hole-event-horizon

Black hole event horizon: Inside the event horizon of a black hole, due to intense gravitational forces, the spacing between SEQ is compressed to its limit. This extreme compression approximately and locally halts:

(1)Energy conduction

(2) space transformations

(3)Entropy increase step (Neglecting black hole accretion).
